## Project Description
Group project focused on the "Flying Sidekick TSP", which is a variant of the "Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)" involving drone-assisted parcel delivery. Specifically FS-TSP is a delivery problem in which a truck and a drone ("Unmanned Aerial Vehicle", UAV) are used as a synchronized working unit to make the delivery process more efficient and, possibly, less expensive.
